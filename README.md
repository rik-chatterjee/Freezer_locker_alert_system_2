# Freezer_locker_alert_system_2
## Description
Many industries like food industry, medicine industry,etc use cold storage to keep perishable items safe, but there may occur some complications in the machine which can cause improper cooling of products resulting in loss of lakhs or even crores of money. This encouraged me to build a  system that can prevent this by notifying the engineer in charge about failure of cooling system before it's too late. It sends an alert email and a message on the engineer's phone number about the failure of cooling system and also sounds a buzzer for notifing the same .
